This repository contains the Systematic Literature Review Process undergone in the paper [10 Years of Variational Autoencoder: Insights from Cancer Temporal Progression Studies, a Systematic Literature Review](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.29.656750v1).

Each folder contains the databases of papers resulting from the used queries on Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science, and the subsequent systematic analysis, to arrive to the final list of selected papers.

Besides, we also include three notebooks with the codes used to remove duplicates, combine the datasets from the different databases into one, and to obtain Figure 2 in the paper.
